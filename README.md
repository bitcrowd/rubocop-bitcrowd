[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rubocop-bitcrowd.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rubocop-bitcrowd)

The bitcrowd rubocop.yml as a gem.

## Installation

Add this lines to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rubocop-bitcrowd', require: false
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

To use the configuration in your project create a `.rubocop.yml` with:

```yml
inherit_gem:
  rubocop-bitcrowd: .rubocop.yml

# Note: skip this if you want to override the default AllCops:Include and AllCops:Exclude list
inherit_mode:
  merge:
    - Include
    - Exclude
```

### Using other rubocop gems

There are also config files for the other `rubocop` gems:
* [rubocop-rails](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-rails)
* [rubocop-rspec](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-rspec)
* [rubocop-performance](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-performance)

To use any of them, add the respective gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rubocop-rails', require: false
gem 'rubocop-rspec', require: false
gem 'rubocop-performance', require: false
```

Then include the bitcrowd config in your `.rubocop.yml`:

```yml
inherit_gem:
  rubocop-bitcrowd:
    - .rubocop.yml
    - .rubocop-rspec.yml
    - .rubocop-rails.yml
    - .rubocop-performance.yml

# Note: skip this if you want to override the default AllCops:Include and AllCops:Exclude list
inherit_mode:
  merge:
    - Include
    - Exclude
```

## Autofixing issues

At bitcrowd we discovered it to be a very good practice to put each automatically fixable Cop into a single commit when initially adding rubocop into a bigger project.

This gem provides a simple script, that can help you with this task:

1. Create your rubocop configuration (either with the instructions above or your own)
2. Create a rubocop_todo.yml with: `rubocop --auto-gen-config`
3. Make sure you have a clean state in git, since the script will make commits for you (you may want to commit your rubocop_todo.yml)
4. Run the script (may take a while, when you want to continue working on your project meanwhile run this in a separate checkout): `rubocop-autofix`
5. Review all commits made by the script and run your tests. You can now drop certain commits of cops you don't want. Often it may make some sense to run the script again with changed settings, since rebasing 100+ commits is no fun.
